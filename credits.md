# Credits

lychee would not be possible without the following projects.
**Thanks a lot to all maintainers and contributors.**

- [robinst/linkify]: Rust library to find links such as URLs and email addresses in plain text, handling surrounding punctuation correctly.
- [reacherhq/check-if-mail-exists]: Check if an email address exists without sending any email.
- [peter-evans/link-checker]: A GitHub action for link checking repository Markdown and HTML files. It served as the original template for lychee-action.
