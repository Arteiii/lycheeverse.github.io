# Replacing Broken Links With Archived Versions

This series of blog posts shows how to replace broken links on your website with
archived versions using
[lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/), querying the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) for archived versions of the broken
links and automatically replacing them in the markdown files with [Wayback
Machine Query Github
Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wayback-machine-query) and
[Replace multiple strings in files
action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/replace-multiple-strings-in-files).

All credits go to [David Gardiner](https://david.gardiner.net.au/) for the
original idea and implementation.
