lychee is also available as a [Github action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/). This way you can set up a job which
regularly checks all links in your repository.
If you like, **it can open an issue when lychee finds problems with your links**.

Please find more information and usage examples on the [official repo](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/)
and the **Github Actions Recipes section**.
