title: Welcome to lychee!

lychee is a fast, async, stream-based link checker written in Rust. ðŸ¦€âœ¨
It finds broken URLs and mail addresses inside **Markdown, HTML,
reStructuredText, websites**, and more!

Let's take a look at some usage examples.

### Check All Links In Current Directory

The following command _recursively_ checks all links in all supported files
inside the current directory.

```bash
lychee .
```

This traverses all subdirectories and checks the links in all files which lychee
supports, such as `.md`, `.html`, and more.

### Check All Links On A Website

```bash
lychee https://example.com
```

This command checks all links on the website `https://example.com`.
It is not recursive and only checks the links on the given page.
Recursion is currently not supported. You can however download the
sitemap of a website and use that as input.

### Check Only Specific Files

```bash
lychee README.md
lychee test.html info.txt
lychee test.html info.txt https://example.com
```

This command checks only the links in the given files.
It also demonstrates how to check multiple inputs, such as files and URLs
in a single command.

### Check Links In Directories, But Block All Network Requests

```bash
lychee --offline path/to/directory
```

This will only check the links in the files in the given directory and not make
any network requests. It is helpful for a quick local "linting" of files.

### Check Links In A Remote File

```bash
lychee https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lycheeverse/lychee/master/README.md
```

If a URL is given as input and it ends with a file extension other than `.html`,
lychee respects the file extension and interprets the file accordingly.
Here, we interpret the file as Markdown.

### Check links from `stdin`

```bash
cat test.md | lychee -
echo 'https://example.com' | lychee -
```

You don't need to put links into a file first. You can also pipe them into lychee
directly.

### Check Links In Local Files Via Shell Glob

```bash
lychee 'public/**/*.html'
```

Have many files in the same directory structure you want to check?
You don't need to list them all. Just use a shell glob!

The above command checks all `.html` files in the `public` directory and its
subdirectories.

:::note[Glob Expansion Rules]
Note that we use single quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the input
before lychee can process it.

### Advanced Globbing And `~` Expansion

```bash
lychee '~/projects/big_project/\*_/README._'
```

This command checks all `README` files inside the `big_project` directory with
files ending in any file extension.
The `~` gets expanded to your home directory.

### Ignore Case When Globbing And Check Result For Each Link

```bash
lychee --glob-ignore-case --verbose '~/projects/\*_/[r]eadme._'
```

In this command, we ignore the case when globbing, so it matches

- `~/projects/my_project_/readme.md`
- `~/projects/cool_app_/README.txt`
- `~/projects/website_/readme.rst`
- `~/projects/rust_game_/README`
- `~/projects/python_script_/Readme.markdown`

### Check Links From Epub File

If you have [atool](https://www.nongnu.org/atool) installed, you can check links inside `.epub` files as well!

```bash
acat -F zip {file.epub} "_.xhtml" "_.html" | lychee -
```

:::caution[Attention]
lychee parses other file formats as plaintext and extracts links using [linkify](https://github.com/robinst/linkify).
This generally works well if there are no format- or encoding
specifics, but in case you need dedicated support for a new file format, please
consider [creating an issue](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues).
